<h2 id="hi">Cookies let you store user information in webpages.<h2>
<h2>Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer. <br>

   When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user. <br> <br>

   Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user": <br>
<ul>  
   <li> When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.</li> 
   <li> Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name.</li>
   <li> Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like:
    username = Rishav Raj </li>
</ul>
</h2>

    <h4>When a browser requests a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the page are added to the request. This way the server gets the necessary data to "remember" information about users.</h4>

    <h3>JavaScript can create, read, and delete cookies with the "document.cookie" property.</h3>

    <h3>In the example to follow, we will create a cookie that stores the name of a visitor. <br>
    <ol>
        <li> The first time a visitor arrives to the web page, he/she will be asked to fill in his/her name. The name is then stored in a cookie. </li> 
        
        <li> The next time the visitor arrives at the same page, he/she will get a welcome message. </li> <br>
        
      <ul> For the example we will create 3 JavaScript functions:
        
      <li>A function to set a cookie value </li>
      <li>A function to get a cookie value </li>
      <li>A function to check a cookie value</li>
      </ul>
      </h3>

<!-- 
    The document.cookie property looks like a normal text string. But it is not.

    Even if you write a whole cookie string to document.cookie, when you read it out again, you can only see the name-value pair of it.
    
    If you set a new cookie, older cookies are not overwritten. The new cookie is added to document.cookie, so if you read document.cookie again you will get something like:
    
    cookie1 = value; cookie2 = value;
    
    Display All Cookies , Create Cookie 1 , Create Cookie 2 Delete Cookie 1 , Delete Cookie 2
    
    If you want to find the value of one specified cookie, you must write a JavaScript function that searches for the cookie value in the cookie string.  -->
