    <h1>How Function work in JS</h1>
    <h2>
    1.   We learnt how functions work in JS. Working given from next points. <br>
    2.   At first a global execution context is created,  which consists of Memory component and code component and has 2 phases: Memory allocation phase and code  execution phase. <br>
    3.   In the first phase, the variables are assigned "undefined" while functions have their own code. <br>
    4.   Whenever there is a function declaration in the code, a separate local execution context gets created having its own phases and is pushed into the call stack. <br>
    5.   Once the function ends, the execution context is removed from the call stack. <br>
    6.   When the program ends, even the global execution context is pulled out of the call stack.
    7.   Now,When whole code is being executed nothing rest to execute then everything will be deleted nothing left all poped out.
