<h1>JavaScript Function bind()</h1>

<p>This example creates 2 objects (person and member).</p>
<p>The member object borrows the fullname method from person:</p> 
<h3>With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.</h3>
<h3>Sometimes the bind() method has to be used to prevent loosing "this". When a function is used as a callback, "this" is lost.The bind() method solves that problem of loosing.</h3>
