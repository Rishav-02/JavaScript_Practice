<h1>JavaScript Fetch API</h1>
<h3>ðŸ˜€ No need for XMLHttpRequest anymore.</h3>
<h3>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.</h3>
<p id="fetch">Fetch a file to change this text.</p>

<script>
//Since fetch returns a Promise, we can also use async/await keywords to make requests:
getText("fetch_info.txt");

async function getText(file) {
  let myObject = await fetch(file);
  let myText = await myObject.text();
  document.getElementById("fetch").innerHTML = myText;
}
</script>
