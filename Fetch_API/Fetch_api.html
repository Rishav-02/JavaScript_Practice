    <h1>Fetch API in JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>Here in POST request API returns a status of 201
        i.e The HTTP status code for Created.
    </h2>
    <h2>The fetch() method is used to send the requests to the server without refreshing the page. It is an alternative to the XMLHttpRequest object.</h2>
    <h2>POST request using fetch API:  <br>
        The post request is widely used to submit forms to the server. Fetch also supports the POST method call. <br> To do a POST request we need to specify additional parameters with the request such as method, headers, etc. </h2>
    <p>The difference between XMLHttpRequest and fetch is that fetch uses Promises which are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code. <br> <br>
        However there are still some browsers that do not support fetch() method, so for those, we have to stick with the XMLHttpRequest object.
        A fetch() method can be used with many type of requests such as POST, GET, PUT and DELETE.</p>
