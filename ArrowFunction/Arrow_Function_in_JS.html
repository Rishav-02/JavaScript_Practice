<!-- Function with Parameters: -->
<!-- hello = (val) => "Hello " + val; -->

<!-- In fact, if you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well: -->
<!-- hello = val => "Hello " + val; -->

<!-- Arrow function -->
<!-- hello = () => {
    return "Hello World!";
  } -->

  <!-- It gets shorter! If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the return keyword: -->
  <!-- hello = () => "Hello World!"; -->
  <!-- Note: This works only if the function has only one statement. -->

<h1>JavaScript "this"</h1>
<h2>Arrow Functions Return Value by Default:</h2>
<p>This program demonstrate that in Arrow Functions, the "this" keyword represents the object that owns the function, no matter who calls the function.</p>

<p>Click the button to execute the "hello" function again, and you will see that "this" still  represents the window object.</p>
<h3>In regular functions the "this" keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.</h3>
<h3>With arrow functions the "this" keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function (owner of the function).</h3>
<li><b>Remember these differences when you are working with functions. Sometimes the behavior of regular functions is what you want, if not, use arrow functions.</b> </li> <br> <br>
<button id="btn">Click Me!</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var hello;

//Arrow function
hello = () => {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this;
}

//The window object calls the function:
window.addEventListener("load", hello);

//A button object calls the function:
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", hello);

// With Regular Function output on clicking the button is: [object HTMLButtonElement]
