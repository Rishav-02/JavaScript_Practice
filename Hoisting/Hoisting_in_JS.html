    <h1>JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.</h1>
    <h3>
      Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the
      top.
    </h3>
    <h3>In JavaScript,a variable can be used before it has been declared.</h3>
    <h3>
      Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to
      the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the
      current function).
    </h3>

    <!-- x = 5; // Assign 5 to x

elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
elem.innerHTML = x;              // Display x in the element

var x; // Declare x   // output is 5 -->
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <p id="host"></p>

    <script>
      var x = 5; // Initialize x
      var y = 7; // Initialize y

      elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
      elem.innerHTML = "x is " + x + " and y is " + y; // Display x and y

      var a = 5; // Initialize a
      var b; // Declare b

      elem = document.getElementById("host"); // Find an element
      elem.innerHTML = "a is " + a + " and b is " + b; // Display a and b

      b = 7; // Assign 7 to b

      //This is same program of above written in other way

      // var a = 5;  // Initialize a

      // elem = document.getElementById("demo"); //Find an element
      // elem.innerHTML = "a is " + a + " and b is " + b;  // Display a and b

      // var b = 7;  // Initialize b
    </script>

    <h2>
      Does it make sense that y is undefined in the second program? <br />

      This is because only the declaration (var y), not the initialization (=7)
      is hoisted to the top. <br />
      <br />

      Because of hoisting, y has been declared before it is used, but because
      initializations are not hoisted, the value of y is undefined.
    </h2>

    <h3>
      Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the
      block,but not initialized. <br /><br />

      Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used
      until it has been declared. <br />

      Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a
      ReferenceError. <br />

      The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block
      until it is declared:
    </h3>

    <!-- let Keyword -->
    <!-- carName = "Volvo"; -->
    <!-- let carName;  -->
    <!-- This will result in a ReferenceError: -->

    <!-- const Keyword -->
    <!-- carName = "Volvo"; -->
    <!-- const carName; -->
    <!-- Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax errror, so the code will simply not run. -->

    <h4>
      If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs
      (errors). <br />
      <br />

      To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every
      scope. <br />
      <br />

      Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good
      rule.
